<h1>How to Translate a Math PDF (Co-written with Gemini 2.5 Pro)</h1>

<p>Nowadays, multimodal AI models can take as input a math paper in a non-English language and output a translation directly in LaTeX. Below is a guide on this. Before proceeding, beware that there are always risks of hallucination or error from the AI and from the fact that this guide was written in April 2025 and was suboptimal even when written.</p>

<p>A quick note: for this to work, the core capability for this task has to exist in the multimodal AI itself. The guide below merely provides scaffolding to overcome the following two common challenges:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Output Length Limits:</strong> AIs often can't generate the entire LaTeX for a long paper in one output, especially via API calls.</li>
    <li><strong>AI Confusion from Input Size:</strong> Processing hundreds of pages of math can sometimes lead to a degradation in translation ability or increased errors.</li>
</ul>

<p>We divide this guide into two main situations.</p>

<h2>Situation 1 (Easiest): Translating Short Papers (e.g., < 20 pages)</h2>

<p>If the paper is short, you can often translate it directly using a chat interface for any capable multimodal AI model (like Google's AI Studio for Gemini).</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Method:</strong> Upload the PDF directly into the chat interface.</li>
    <li><strong>Prompt:</strong> Use a prompt like this:
        <pre><code>Please translate the uploaded document into English LaTeX code. Ensure all mathematical formulas and environments are preserved correctly. Generate the complete LaTeX document, including a suitable preamble.</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Process:</strong> Copy the AI's generated LaTeX output, paste it into your LaTeX editor (e.g., Overleaf), compile, and carefully review the resulting PDF.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Situation 2: Translation for Longer Papers via an API</h2>

<p>For longer papers, we must divide the paper into manageable chunks for translation. Using the Gemini API, it is possible to write code to automate this process. The philosophy here is that the scaffolding imposed on the AI model should be minimal, so as not to interfere with the AI's own ability to process and translate effectively.</p>

<p>The basic script workflow involves these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Determine how to split the PDF into chunks (e.g., based on logical sections suggested by the AI, or simply using fixed page counts).</li>
    <li>Call the Gemini API for each chunk, sending the relevant pages (potentially as images or extracted text, depending on the chosen API capabilities and complexity) for translation into LaTeX format.</li>
    <li>Combine the resulting LaTeX pieces generated for each chunk into a single, final <code>.tex</code> file.</li>
</ol>

<!-- User's corrected paragraph -->
<p>We provide an <a href="pdf_latex_translator.py" download>example script</a> written with Gemini.
<!-- Make sure pdf_latex_translator.py is in the same directory as this HTML file, or adjust the href path -->
In order the use this script, you first need to obtain a Gemini API key and set up a Python environment with the necessary libraries installed. </p>

<p>I'll let Gemini explain in more detail:</p>

    <h3>How to Use the Python Script</h3>
    <p>(Assuming you have downloaded the image-based translator script, let's call it <code>pdf_latex_translator_vision.py</code>)</p>

    <h4>1. Requirements:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Python Environment:</strong> A working Python installation (version 3.x recommended). Using a virtual environment (like `venv`) is highly recommended.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Required Python Packages:</strong> Install these using pip (or pip3):
            <pre><code>pip install google-generativeai pdf2image Pillow pypdf python-dotenv</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>External Dependency: Poppler:</strong> The `pdf2image` library requires the Poppler PDF rendering library. You must install it separately:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>macOS (using Homebrew):</strong> <code>brew install poppler</code></li>
                <li><strong>Debian/Ubuntu Linux:</strong> <code>sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install poppler-utils</code></li>
                <li><strong>Windows:</strong> Download pre-built binaries (e.g., from <a href="https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">poppler-windows releases</a> or via conda/MSYS2) and ensure the `bin` directory containing `pdftoppm.exe`, `pdfinfo.exe` etc. is added to your system's PATH environment variable.</li>
            </ul>
            <em>Failure to install Poppler correctly is a common reason for errors.</em>
        </li>
        <li><strong>LaTeX Distribution:</strong> You need a way to compile the final <code>.tex</code> file (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX installed locally, or an online editor like Overleaf).</li>
        <li><strong>Gemini API Key:</strong> Obtain an API key from <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google AI Studio</a>. Save this key securely, for example in a <code>.env</code> file in the same directory as the script (format: <code>GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE</code>) or as a system environment variable (<code>GEMINI_API_KEY</code> or <code>GOOGLE_API_KEY</code>).</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Run the Script:</h4>
    <p>
        Execute the script from your terminal. You **must** provide two arguments in order:
        <ol>
             <li>The path to the <strong>input PDF</strong> file you want to translate.</li>
             <li>The path where you want to save the resulting <strong>output LaTeX (.tex)</strong> file.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>Here is the command structure:</p>
    <pre><code>python pdf_latex_translator_vision.py "path/to/your/input_document.pdf" "path/to/your/output_document.tex"</code></pre>
    <ul>
        <li>Replace <code>"path/to/your/input_document.pdf"</code> with the actual path to your source PDF.</li>
        <li>Replace <code>"path/to/your/output_document.tex"</code> with the desired path for the generated LaTeX file.</li>
        <li>Use quotes around paths if they contain spaces.</li>
        <li><em>Note: Depending on your system configuration, you might need to use <code>python3</code> instead of <code>python</code>.</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Optional Arguments:</h4>
    <p>Customize the script's execution by adding these flags *after* the two required paths:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>--env path/to/.env</code>: Specify a different path for your <code>.env</code> file containing the API key.</li>
        <li>
            <code>--model model_name</code>: Specify a Gemini vision model. The script defaults to <code>gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25</code>, considered a strong free experimental model as of April 2025 (note: free experimental models may have stricter usage limits and could change or be removed). If you encounter rate limits or require more stability/higher throughput, consider using the paid <code>gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25</code> model. Always check Google's documentation for current model availability, capabilities, rate limits, and pricing.
        </li>
        <li><code>--start_page N</code>: Start processing from page number N (1-based). Useful for resuming after an interruption. The script will attempt to load existing content from the output file if starting from page > 1.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Explanation and Key Features of the Script</h3>
    <p>(This section outlines the script's internal logic. Refer to the script's comments for full details.)</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>API Key Loading:</strong> Securely loads the Gemini API key.</li>
        <li><strong>PDF Page Handling:</strong> Uses <code>pypdf</code> to get the page count and <code>pdf2image</code> (requiring Poppler) to convert each PDF page into an image.</li>
        <li><strong>Page-by-Page Image Processing:</strong> Iterates through the document one page at a time, converting each to an image format suitable for the API.</li>
        <li><strong>Gemini Vision Translation:</strong> Sends each page's <strong>image data</strong> along with a carefully crafted text prompt to the specified Gemini vision model (defaulting to <code>gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25</code>). The prompt instructs the AI to translate text, accurately preserve math/formulas from the image, maintain structure, and handle the LaTeX preamble only on the first page processed.</li>
        <li><strong>Contextual Prompts:</strong> Includes a snippet of the previously generated LaTeX in prompts for subsequent pages to help the AI maintain continuity.</li>
        <li><strong>Combining Output:</strong> Concatenates the LaTeX code returned for each page image into a single string, adding <code>\end{document}</code> only at the very end.</li>
        <li><strong>Error Handling & Retries:</strong> Includes checks for file access, PDF reading, critical image conversion errors (often Poppler-related), and API call failures (with basic retries). Inserts error comments into the output file for failed pages.</li>
        <li><strong>Simplified State/Resume:</strong> Uses the <code>--start_page</code> argument and checks for the existence of the output file to provide basic resume capability (less robust than a dedicated state file).</li>
        <li><strong>Command-Line Interface:</strong> Uses <code>argparse</code> for flexibility in specifying files and options.</li>
        <li><strong>Logging:</strong> Provides progress updates and error messages during execution.</li>
    </ul>
