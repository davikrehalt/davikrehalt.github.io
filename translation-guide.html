<h1>How to Translate Math PDFs into LaTeX using AI (Jointly written with Gemini 2.5 Pro)</h1>

<p>Nowadays, my preferred method for reading non-English math papers is to feed them into a multimodal AI model and ask for a translation directly into LaTeX format. I find current AI translations mostly sufficient, and rarely need to refer to the original paper. The speed and readability benefits, for me, often outweigh the risks of AI hallucination or error, though you must always weigh this trade-off yourself. Here I record one (probably far from optimal) way of doing this (we will use Gemini 2.5 Pro by default since it is considered a strong model for math as of April 2025).</p>

<p>The core capability for this task has to exist in the multimodal AI itself for this approach to work. The guide below merely provides scaffolding to overcome the following two common challenges:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Output Length Limits:</strong> AIs often can't generate the entire LaTeX for a long paper in one output, especially via API calls.</li>
    <li><strong>AI Confusion from Input Size:</strong> Processing hundreds of pages of math can sometimes lead to a degradation in translation ability or increased errors.</li>
</ul>

<p>We divide this guide into two main situations.</p>

<h2>Situation 1 (Easiest): Translating Short Papers (e.g., < 20 pages)</h2>

<p>If the paper is short, you can often translate it directly using a chat interface for any capable multimodal AI model (like Google's AI Studio for Gemini).</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Method:</strong> Upload the PDF directly into the chat interface.</li>
    <li><strong>Prompt:</strong> Use a prompt like this:
        <pre><code>Please translate the uploaded document into English LaTeX code. Ensure all mathematical formulas and environments are preserved correctly. Generate the complete LaTeX document, including a suitable preamble.</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Process:</strong> Copy the AI's generated LaTeX output, paste it into your LaTeX editor (e.g., Overleaf), compile, and carefully review the resulting PDF.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Situation 2: Translation for Longer Papers via an API</h2>

<p>For longer papers, we must divide the paper into manageable chunks for translation. Using the Gemini API, we can write code to automate this process. The philosophy here is that the scaffolding imposed on the AI model should be minimal, so as not to interfere with the AI's own ability to process and translate effectively.</p>

<p>The basic script workflow involves these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Determine how to split the PDF into chunks (e.g., based on logical sections suggested by the AI, or simply using fixed page counts).</li>
    <li>Call the Gemini API for each chunk, sending the relevant pages (potentially as images or extracted text, depending on the chosen API capabilities and complexity) for translation into LaTeX format.</li>
    <li>Combine the resulting LaTeX pieces generated for each chunk into a single, final <code>.tex</code> file.</li>
</ol>

<p>In order for this automated approach to work, you first need to obtain a Gemini API key and set up a Python environment on your computer. Once that's done, you can use the script provided below. Note that I generated all the code presented here with assistance from Gemini.</p>

<p>You can download the example Python script here: <a href="pdf_latex_translator.py" download>pdf_latex_translator.py</a>.</p>
<!-- Make sure pdf_latex_translator.py is in the same directory as this HTML file, or adjust the href path -->

<p>To generate or modify such a script yourself, you can provide a detailed prompt to an AI coding assistant. See the comments within the downloadable script file for the type of prompt used for its generation.</p>
